LRS Conformance Test Suite
==========================

### Description

This is a NodeJS project that tests the 'MUST' requirements of the xAPI Spec, determined by the governing documents for the various versions of the xAPI Spec. This is actively being developed and new tests will be periodically added based on the testing requirements. Currently, this test suite only supports basic authentication. This test suite should also not run against a production LRS endpoint because the data is persisted and never voided.

- For xAPI versions 1.0.3 and earlier, the documentation can be found on the **[ADL Initiative GitHub repository](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec)**
- For xAPI versions 2.0 and later, these will be hosted on the **[IEEE GitLab repository](https://opensource.ieee.org/xapi/xapi-base-standard-documentation)**

### xAPI 2.0 Update

xAPI 2.0 changed a number of requirements for the LRS from previous versions; most of these are additions supporting new features, while others have been removed. The details of the changes may be seen in the updated xAPI Spec.

The following are the major changes that warranted the creation of additional tests in the conformance suite:
- Full support and validation for context agents and context groups
- 2.0.x is a valid set of xAPI versions
- Timestamps may be represented in the RFC 3339 format (changed from strict ISO 8601)
- If a timestamp is not formatted to UTC, the LRS will convert the timestamp instead of rejecting the statement
- Alternate Request Syntax is no longer supported and therefore not tested
- LRS responses now include `Last-Modified` headers

### Installation  

Dependency  
This requires npm for installation.  NodeJS version 8.x or later at a minimum, but it's recommended to use the latest LTS release.

Clone and install

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adlnet/lrs-conformance-test-suite.git
$ cd lrs-conformance-test-suite
$ npm install
```

Verify installation
```bash
$ node bin/console_runner.js --help

    -s, --consumer_secret [string]     oAuth 1 Consumer Secert
    -r, --request_token_path [string]  Path to OAuth request token endpoint (relative to endpoint)
    -t, --auth_token_path [string]     Path to OAuth authorization token endpoint (relative to endpoint)
    -l, --authorization_path [string]  Path to OAuth user authorization endpoint (relative to endpoint)
    -g, --grep [string]                Only run tests that match the given pattern
    -b, --bail                         Abort the battery if one test fails
    -x, --xapiVersion [string]         ðŸŒŸ New: Version of the xAPI spec to test against
    -d, --directory [value]            Specific directories of tests (as a comma seperated list with no spaces)
    -z, --errors                       Results log of failing tests only
```

### Running the Test Suite

Example Basic Authentication:

```bash
$ node bin/console_runner.js -e <http://localhost/xapi> -a -u <username> -p <password>
-or-
$ node bin/console_runner.js --endpoint <http://localhost/xapi> --basicAuth --authUser <username> --authPass <password>
```

Example OAuth1 Authentication:

```bash
$ node bin/console_runner.js -e <http://localhost/xapi> -o -c <consumer_key> -s <consumer_secret> -r <request_token_path> -t <auth_token_path> -l <authorization_path>
-or-
$ node bin/console_runner.js --endpoint <http://localhost/xapi> --oAuth1 --consumer_key <consumer_key> --consumer_secret <consumer_secret> --request_token_path <request_token_path> --auth_token_path <auth_token_path> --authorization_path <authorization_path>
```

Example with Grep:

```bash
$ node bin/console_runner.js -a -e <http://localhost/xapi> -a -u <username> -p <password> -g "<string or pattern to match>"
-or-
$ node bin/console_runner.js --endpoint <http://localhost/xapi> --basicAuth --authUser <username> --authPass <password> --grep "<string or pattern to match>"
```

**Note:** Grep is a useful tool to run only specific tests or a group of tests which meet a specific pattern.  For example using a specific requirement number (XAPI-00113) or a specific section of the spec (Data 2.4.1).

Example using Option for Log Containing Only Errors:

```bash
$ node bin/console_runner.js -e <http://localhost/xapi> -a -u <username> -p <password> -z
-or-
$ node bin/console_runner.js --endpoint <http://localhost/xapi> --basicAuth --authUser <username> --authPass <password> --errors
```

**Note:** The default log contains results from every test run in the suite both passed and failed.  The --errors option filters the log to contain only tests which have failed.
